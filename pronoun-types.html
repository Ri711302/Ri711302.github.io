        <h1>Pronouns and Their Types</h1>

        <h2>1. What is a Pronoun?</h2>
        <p>A pronoun is a word that is used in place of a noun to avoid unnecessary repetition in speech or writing. Instead of repeating the same noun, we use a pronoun to make sentences smoother and clearer.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong><br>
            Rita is my friend. Rita is very kind. (Repetition of “Rita”)<br>
            Rita is my friend. <strong>She</strong> is very kind. (The pronoun <strong>she</strong> replaces “Rita”).
        </div>
        <h3>Functions of Pronouns:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Avoid repetition</li>
            <li>Make sentences clearer</li>
            <li>Show possession</li>
            <li>Connect clauses</li>
            <li>Emphasise meaning</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Types of Pronouns</h2>

        <h3>A. Personal Pronouns</h3>
        <p>These refer to specific people or things. They change depending on person (first, second, third), number (singular, plural), and case (subject, object).</p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Subjective case (doer):</strong> I, we, you, he, she, it, they</li>
            <li><strong>Objective case (receiver):</strong> me, us, you, him, her, it, them</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example sentences:</strong><br>
