  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    The Pacific Ring of Fire is a horseshoe-shaped zone around the edges of the Pacific Ocean. 
    It is one of the most geologically active regions on Earth, known for its frequent 
    <strong>earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and mountain-building processes</strong>. 
    About <strong>75% of the world‚Äôs active volcanoes</strong> and 
    <strong>90% of the world‚Äôs earthquakes</strong> occur here.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Location</h2>
  <p>
    The Ring of Fire stretches for about <strong>40,000 km (25,000 miles)</strong>. 
    It passes through several continents and countries, including 
    <em>Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, Chile, Mexico, Canada, 
    and the United States (Alaska and the west coast)</em>.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Causes of Activity</h2>
  <p>The main reason for the intense geological activity in the Ring of Fire is <strong>plate tectonics</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Subduction Zones:</strong> One tectonic plate sinks beneath another, creating volcanoes and deep ocean trenches.</li>
    <li><strong>Transform Faults:</strong> Plates slide past each other, causing earthquakes.</li>
    <li><strong>Divergent Boundaries:</strong> Plates move apart, allowing magma to rise.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Major Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Volcanoes:</strong> Examples include Mount Fuji (Japan), Krakatoa (Indonesia), and Mount St. Helens (USA).</li>
    <li><strong>Earthquake Zones:</strong> Japan, Chile, and California are hotspots for powerful quakes.</li>
    <li><strong>Ocean Trenches:</strong> Such as the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the Earth‚Äôs oceans.</li>
    <li><strong>Island Arcs:</strong> Chains of volcanic islands, such as the Philippines and Aleutian Islands.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Importance of the Ring of Fire</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Scientific Research:</strong> Helps geologists understand Earth‚Äôs internal processes.</li>
    <li><strong>Natural Resources:</strong> Rich in minerals, geothermal energy, and fertile soils.</li>
    <li><strong>Risks:</strong> Causes destruction through earthquakes, tsunamis, and eruptions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Countries Most Affected</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Japan</strong> ‚Äì frequent earthquakes and tsunamis.</li>
    <li><strong>Indonesia</strong> ‚Äì many volcanoes, including some of the most dangerous.</li>
    <li><strong>Chile</strong> ‚Äì powerful earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.</li>
    <li><strong>United States (West Coast & Alaska)</strong> ‚Äì prone to quakes and volcanic activity.</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>7. Fun Facts about the Ring of Fire</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>üåã About <strong>452 volcanoes</strong> are located along the Ring of Fire.</li>
      <li>üåä The <strong>Mariana Trench</strong>, part of the Ring, is the <strong>deepest place on Earth</strong> (over 11,000 metres deep).</li>
      <li>üåç Roughly <strong>90% of the world‚Äôs earthquakes</strong> happen here.</li>
      <li>üèù Some islands like <strong>Hawaii</strong> are volcanic in origin but are <em>not</em> part of the Ring of Fire.</li>
      <li>‚è≥ The Ring of Fire has been active for <strong>millions of years</strong> and continues to shape Earth‚Äôs surface today.</li>

    <h2>8. Summary</h2>
    <p>
      The Pacific Ring of Fire is a vast area surrounding the Pacific Ocean where the Earth‚Äôs tectonic plates 
      collide, slide, and move apart. This movement creates earthquakes, volcanoes, and trenches, 
      making it the most seismically active region on Earth. 
      While it poses many dangers, it also provides fertile soils, geothermal energy, and important scientific insights.
