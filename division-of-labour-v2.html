    <h1>Division of Labour</h1>

    <h2>1. Meaning of Division of Labour</h2>
    <p>Division of labour means <strong>breaking down work into smaller parts</strong> and allowing different people to specialise in each part.</p>
    <p>Instead of one person doing all the work, each person focuses on a specific task to make work faster and easier.</p>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <p>In a bakery –</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One person mixes the flour.</li>
      <li>Another bakes the bread.</li>
      <li>Another packages the bread.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Together, they produce more bread than if one person did everything.</p>

    <h2>2. Types of Division of Labour</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Simple Division of Labour</strong><br />
        Work is divided among people in a small group, family, or community.<br />
        <em>Example:</em> In a family farm, one child waters crops while another weeds.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Complex Division of Labour</strong><br />
        Work is divided on a larger scale, such as in industries and factories.<br />
        <em>Example:</em> In a car factory, some workers make tyres, others assemble engines, while others spray paint the cars.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>3. Examples of Division of Labour</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>In schools: Teachers specialise in different subjects (Maths, English, Science).</li>
      <li>In hospitals: Doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and cleaners all play different roles.</li>
      <li>In construction: Bricklayers, carpenters, plumbers, and electricians work together to build houses.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Advantages of Division of Labour</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Increased efficiency</strong> – People become skilled by repeating the same task.</li>
      <li><strong>Saves time</strong> – No need to move from one task to another.</li>
      <li><strong>More production</strong> – Goods and services are produced faster and in larger quantities.</li>
      <li><strong>Encourages invention</strong> – Specialisation leads to new tools and methods.</li>
      <li><strong>Better quality</strong> – Workers focus on one task and do it well.</li>
      <li><strong>Creates employment</strong> – Different roles provide jobs for many people.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>5. Disadvantages of Division of Labour</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Boredom</strong> – Repeating the same task daily can be tiring.</li>
      <li><strong>Over-dependence</strong> – If one worker fails, the whole process may stop.</li>
      <li><strong>Loss of skill</strong> – A worker may only know one part of the job and nothing else.</li>
      <li><strong>Monotony</strong> – Work becomes less interesting.</li>
      <li><strong>Risk of unemployment</strong> – Machines may replace workers who do simple, repetitive tasks.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>6. Difference Between Division of Labour and Specialisation</h2>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Division of Labour</th>
          <th>Specialisation</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Breaking work into smaller parts</td>
          <td>Concentrating on one skill or job</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Involves many people doing different tasks</td>
          <td>Involves one person becoming an expert</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><em>Example:</em> Car factory (different roles)</td>
          <td><em>Example:</em> A doctor specialising in surgery</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>7. Importance of Division of Labour in Society</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Helps in <strong>mass production</strong> of goods.</li>
      <li>Improves the <strong>quality of products</strong>.</li>
      <li>Promotes <strong>trade and exchange</strong> of goods and services.</li>
      <li>Encourages <strong>teamwork</strong> and cooperation.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>8. Summary</h2>
    <div class="summary">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Division of labour</strong> = sharing work into parts, with different people handling each part.</li>
        <li><strong>Advantages</strong> = efficiency, saves time, more production, better quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Disadvantages</strong> = boredom, over-dependence, loss of skill.</li>
        <li>It is very important in schools, hospitals, factories, farms, and society as a whole.</li>
